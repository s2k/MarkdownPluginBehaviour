# A Main Header

This `Markdown` file references various files:

A text file _without_ any extension is referenced first:

![](resources/texts/extensionless_file)

Second a text file is included that does indicate it's file type by means of an extension:

![](resources/texts/clearly_a_text_file.txt)

And third, here's some Ruby code:

![](resources/code/ruby_code.rb)
